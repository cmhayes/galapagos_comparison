    <div class="textHead">Galapagos Comparison</div>
    <div class="textPHead">Located in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Ecuador, the Galapagos Islands is known for its
    rich biodiversity that inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.  The volcanic archipelago consists of 18 main
    islands and is one of the few places on Earth that has remained largely untouched by human inhabitants, as 97% is national park.

              <div class="textP">While the Galapagos is located on the Equator, the Humboldt Current carries cooler water to
	      the islands, translating to a moist, often rainy, climate.  In addition to frequent rain and high humidity, the
	      Galapagos is often affected by El Nino events, which occur every 3-7 years and are associated with warm water
	      temperatures, a depletion of nutrients in the water and a rise in the sea level.  For most years, the cooler season,
	      which is referred to as garua, runs from June to November, while the warm season stretches from December to May.
	      Because the islands vary in altitude, location and terrain, the weather varies as well. 
		<br /><br />
              Similarly, because the United States has such varied landscapes and regions, the climate and weather varies substantially.
	      While certain states frequently receive snow and rain, others are characterized by extensive dry seasons and excessive heat.</div>

              <div class="textP">Lauded for being a "natural laboratory", the Galapagos Islands is home to some of the highest
	      levels of endemism in the world.  80% of land birds, 97% of reptiles and land mammals, 20% of marine species,
	      and more than 30% of plants found on the islands are endemic and are considered some of the most valuable assets
	      of the islands.  However, due to exponential growth of residents, vehicles and ships, the Ecuadorian Government
	      issued Presidential Decree N 270 in April 2007, declaring that the Galapagos Archipelago is at risk and its conservation
	      is a national priority.  The Galapagos Report of 2009-2010 reiterated the government's sentiment, concluding: 
		<br /><br />
              "Galapagos is not a paradise separate from the rest of the world.  It is a constellation of very fragile ecosystems
	      that now requires special care and attention to ensure that the forces of globalization do not overcome its capacity
	      to assimilate, adapt, and recuperate from natural and human-made disturbances." (Tapia, et. al, p.12)
		<br /><br />
              The United States, on the other hand, only has 27.08% of its land marked as nationally protected area.  Despite the
	      disparity in percentages, the United States also faces conservation issues.  In fact, the Nature Conservancy concluded
	      that in one of every four states, more than 10% of native species are at risk. </div>

              <div class="textP">As it becomes an increasingly popular vacation destination, the Galapagos relies heavily on
	      tourism, which comprises 53% of its revenue.  Many of the most successful residents are those who own souvenir
	      shops close to the shore near cruise ship docks and the Charles Darwin Research Station.  In a survey conducted
	      by the Charles Darwin Foundation in 2009 of 100 business owners in Puerto Ayora - the largest city in the Galapagos -
	      the general consensus was made that employers would rather hire employees from the mainland rather than individuals
	      native to the Galapagos because "local workers charge more and don't work well."  (Villarreal & Grenier, p. 115).
	      In general, researchers and academics alike have concluded that the Galapagos economy still has much room for improvement
	      and growth.  As one researcher articulates: 
		<br /><br />
              "There appears to be no integration of the industry, its employees, and its economic trajectory into a long - term
	      vision that values sustainable and island-appropriate development." (Villarreal & Grenier, pg. 120)
		<br /><br />
              While the Galapagos relies almost entirely on one industry to generate revenues and jobs for its residents, the United
	      States offers more variety, generating significant revenues from numerous industries, including finance, insurance,
	      real estate, retail trade, educational services and manufacturing.  The United States also generates significantly
	      larger revenues than the Galapagos and boasts a higher median household income. </div>

              <div class="textP">Some of the largest discrepancies in the quality of life in the Galapagos and in the United States
	      stem from the disparities in the quality of health care.  Ecuador offers free public health care to its citizens, which
	      explains why the Galapagos allocates a much larger percentage of its budget to health care needs.  However, it is important to
	      note that while the states set aside a smaller portion of their budgets to health care, they spend significantly more on health
	      expenditures.  Accordingly, the United States boasts numerous doctors, advanced equipment, and clean facilities, while the Galapagos
	      lacks all three elements.  In a 2009-2010 report on the economic and social state of the Galapagos, researchers discovered:  
		<br /><br />
              "Most of those surveyed agreed that they do not trust doctors working in Galapagos, and that 'any illness more serious
	      than a cold should be treated on the mainland.' All agreed that health care in Galapagos is poor and more should be done
	      to attract doctors and specialists to the islands." (Villarreal & Grenier, p. 118)</div>
